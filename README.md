# Apple Wallet Ionic Framework Demo

This is the repo for the Apple Wallet demo application built using Ionic Framework. This was built for the Ionic Framework team's 2020 Hack Day. There are plenty of code skeletons as I only had a few hours to build this :blush:. Places for improvement are denoted with "TODO" comments.

This application was build specifically for iPhones and may not function properly on desktop/Android devices.
