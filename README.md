# Apple Wallet Ionic Framework Demo

This is the repo for the Apple Wallet demo application built using Ionic Framework. This was built for the Ionic Framework team's 2020 Hack Day. There are plenty of code skeletons (and probably some bugs) as I only had a few hours to build this :blush:. Places for improvement are denoted with "TODO" comments.

This application was built specifically for iPhones running iOS 13+ and may not function properly on desktop/Android devices. Also I only added theming for dark mode, so it probably will not look great in light mode :smiley:.
